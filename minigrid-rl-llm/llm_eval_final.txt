Since the agent's position and the red ball's position are known, the next subgoal should be to move towards the red ball. The most efficient way to do this would be to move forward, as the agent is already facing in the general direction of the red ball. However, since the agent is facing west and the red ball is to the east, the agent needs to turn around first. The primitive action that corresponds to turning around is turning right twice (or turning left twice), but the most straightforward action would be to turn right, as this will eventually allow the agent to face the correct direction and move towards the red ball.",

    reasoning="To accomplish the mission of opening a door behind the agent, we first need to identify the doors in the maze and their locations relative to the agent. The agent is currently facing east, as indicated by the '>' symbol. The doors in the maze are colored and their locations are as follows: yellow door (YD) to the south, grey door (ZD) to the north, purple door (PD) to the south, and green door (GD) to the south. Since the agent needs to open a door behind it, it must first turn around to face the doors that are behind it, which includes the grey door (ZD). The agent's current position and the position of the doors suggest that the grey door (ZD) is the closest door behind the agent. Therefore, the agent needs to turn around to face west and then move towards the grey door (ZD) to open it.",

Mission: open a door behind you
LLM Response: Prediction(
    reasoning="The agent's mission is to open a door behind it. Given the current state of the maze, the agent is facing west and there are several doors behind it (east direction), but the closest one is the grey door (ZD). To open the door, the agent first needs to turn around to face the door and then move towards it. Since the agent is currently facing west, it needs to turn around to face east. The primitive action to turn the agent to the right (which would be south, then west is not an option since the agent is already facing west, so the next turn would be north and then finally east) is not necessary in this case, as the agent can turn left to face south and then continue turning left to face east. However, the most straightforward action to achieve the desired orientation (facing east) would be to turn the agent to the right until it faces east, but since the agent can only turn left or right, it will turn left three times (or right once, but the description will follow the turn left logic for consistency). However, considering the available actions (0 for left, 1 for right), the most efficient way to face east would indeed be to turn right, which corresponds to action 1.",

Mission: open a door behind you
LLM Response: Prediction(
    reasoning="To accomplish the mission of opening a door behind the agent, we first need to identify the doors in the maze and their relative positions to the agent. The agent is currently facing east, as indicated by the '>' symbol. Looking at the maze layout, there are four doors: a green door (GD) to the north, a yellow door (YD) to the south, a blue door (BD) to the south, and a red door (RD) to the west. Since the mission is to open a door behind the agent, and the agent is facing east, the door behind the agent would be to the west. Therefore, the agent needs to turn around to face the door behind it, which is the red door (RD), and then move towards it to open it.",

The agent needs to turn around to face the doors and then move towards them to open one. Since the agent is initially facing north, it should first turn around to face south. This can be achieved by turning right twice (or left twice), but the most straightforward approach would be to turn around directly if such an action were available. However, based on the provided actions (turn left, turn right, move forward, pick up, drop, toggle, done), the agent can turn around by turning right twice.

Looking at the current state of the maze, we see there are two boxes: a yellow box (YB) and a blue box (BB). The agent is currently facing north, indicated by the '^' symbol. Since the mission is to pick up any box, we should first navigate towards the closest box. The closest box to the agent appears to be the blue box (BB), which is located a few steps to the south and then to the east of the agent's current position. However, to determine the exact sequence of actions, we need to consider the most direct path to the box while avoiding obstacles like walls (W) and potentially other objects that could interfere with our path.\n\nGiven that the agent starts with no previous actions, our first step should be to move towards the blue box. The agent needs to turn right to face east and then move forward to start heading in the general direction of the blue box.
